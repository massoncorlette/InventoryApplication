# InventoryApplication
This project I am really trying to orient myself and get a beginners taste for full stack. It centers around CRUD methods for my category data (genre and directors) and item data (movies), being able to do each CRUD method for both data types, whilst going through routes with controllers to deal with data. 

Using Express I am using the backend framework to setup my route paths, and using middleware modules from my controllers to deal with the data I want from the HTML body to create/update data.  

Focusing on MVC Pattern structure, GET/POST requests from form to DB, Handling data requests with async, handling data dynamically for templated view.

Run:
npm install express
npm install express-validator
npm install pg
npm install dotenv
